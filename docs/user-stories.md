As a csgo player for about 3 years now, and I have been wanting to make the switch to fornite. I would like a direct conversion of my mouse sensitivity, so i have comfortable feel starting fresh on Fortnite.


I have been playing PUBG for about 5 months now, I'm wondering if my sensitivity might be to low. I want to know what everybody else is using.

I have been grindning the Overwatch ladder for about 6 seasons now. I have made very little progress. I wonder if there are recommended setting to tweak that might give me a better advantage.
