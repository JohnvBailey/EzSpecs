 ## Milestone Deliverable
 
 In the current of the state of the app, the room is operational currentl holding data created upon creation. 
Held within a spinner on the main activity. No other functions yet, debating on adding the target game fragment to be just another spinner 
on the main activity. Possibly (at a later time) will switch back to the onscreen buttons, instead of the spinner for a better user experience.
